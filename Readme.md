# Shell Scripting 10-Day Learning Plan (Basic)

This is the **final 10-day basic shell scripting plan** to follow from scratch. Each day is structured as a checklist with practical exercises.

---

## Day 1: Shell Basics and Script Setup

**Checklist:**

* [ ] Understand the purpose of shell scripting
* [ ] Learn about shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) and script execution
* [ ] Set script permissions using `chmod +x`
* [ ] Run a shell script from the terminal
* [ ] Use `echo` and `printf` to print messages
* [ ] Use comments (`#`) effectively in scripts

---

## Day 2: Variables and User Input

**Checklist:**

* [ ] Create and use variables
* [ ] Understand variable types (strings, numbers)
* [ ] Take user input using `read`
* [ ] Use variables in commands and expressions

---

## Day 3: Conditionals (if, else, elif)

**Checklist:**

* [ ] Implement if statements
* [ ] Use else and elif for multiple conditions
* [ ] Combine logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) with conditionals
* [ ] Practice simple decision-making scripts

---

## Day 4: Loops

**Checklist:**

* [ ] Use `for` loops to iterate over sequences or lists
* [ ] Use `while` loops for conditional repetition
* [ ] Practice nested loops
* [ ] Combine loops with conditionals in scripts

---

## Day 5: Case Statements and Basic Arithmetic

**Checklist:**

* [ ] Implement `case` statements for multi-choice logic
* [ ] Perform arithmetic operations using `expr` and `$(( ))`
* [ ] Practice small number-based scripts
* [ ] Solve simple problems like sum, reverse, even/odd checks

---

## Day 6: String Manipulation

**Checklist:**

* [ ] Concatenate strings
* [ ] Find string length
* [ ] Reverse strings
* [ ] Check for palindrome strings
* [ ] Identify vowels and consonants in a string

---

## Day 7: Basic File Handling

**Checklist:**

* [ ] Check if a file exists
* [ ] Read from a file
* [ ] Write to a file
* [ ] Count lines, words, and characters
* [ ] Read file line-by-line

---

## Day 8: Functions

**Checklist:**

* [ ] Define and call functions
* [ ] Pass arguments to functions (`$1`, `$2`)
* [ ] Return values from functions
* [ ] Modularize scripts using functions
* [ ] Combine loops, conditionals, and functions

---

## Day 9: Basic Debugging and Error Handling

**Checklist:**

* [ ] Use `set -x` and `set -e` for debugging
* [ ] Check last command exit status using `$?`
* [ ] Use conditional execution (`&&`, `||`) for error handling
* [ ] Write scripts that handle simple errors gracefully

---

## Day 10: Practice Mini Project (Basic)

**Checklist:**

* [ ] Combine scripts learned from previous days
* [ ] Create a simple script using user input, loops, conditionals, and functions
* [ ] Test and debug the script
* [ ] Ensure output is clear and correct

---

**Note:** This plan focuses on **basic shell scripting concepts**. Once you are comfortable, you can move on to an **advanced plan** with real-time examples, automation tasks, and DevOps-style scripts.
